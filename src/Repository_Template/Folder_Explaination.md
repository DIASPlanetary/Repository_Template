# Folder Purpose

- In this folder is typically your source code.
- This would be code should be mostly definitions that you would import when coding.
- If you have examples such as notebooks the main coding would be contained in here, the notebook would explain what the code does without showing all the long source code.
- This code will make it easy for you to have figure notebooks that do little more than create the figure and load an interact with the data (so that users know how the data is used)
